## About

InMap is an inventory management application that automatically generates an updated inventory for your business when an invoice is scanned to create an accurate account of your supplies.

It is made with React/Redux on the frontend and Ruby/Rails on the backend. It also uses Docker for containerization, GraphQL/Apollo for database queries and is hosted on Heroku.
